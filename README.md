# Data Overview

The data was gathered using an online survey platform where anonymous users responded to each question. The information was then processed to obtain 17 attributes and 2111 
records. The data consisted of the estimation of obesity levels in people from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, with ages between 14 and 61 and diverse eating 
habits and physical condition. 
Frequency of high-calorie food consumption (FAVC), Frequency of vegetable consumption (FCVC), Number of main meals (NCP), Food consumption between meals (CAEC), Daily water 
consumption (CH20), and Alcohol consumption (CALC) are the attributes associated with eating habits. The monitoring of calories consumed (SCC), frequency of physical 
activity (FAF), time spent using technological devices (TUE), and mode of transportation (MTRANS) are the attributes associated with physical condition.

The objectives of this project is to:

•  Ascertain whether eating patterns (FAVC, FCVC, CAEC) and physical state (SCC, FAF, TUE, MTRANS) are correlated in any way.

•  Examine the effects on general health of daily water, alcohol, and food consumption between meals.

•  Explore the relationship between frequency of physical activity and mode of transportation.

•  Investigate the association between time spent using technological devices and physical condition attributes. Understanding how screen time affects factors like calorie     consumption

# Data Collection

  The dataset used in this project was gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster and came in a CSV FORMAT.

  This dataset includes information for estimating obesity rates in people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia based on their physical characteristics and eating patterns. With    regard to classification, clustering, and regression, the data can be categorized using the following values: insufficient weight, normal weight, overweight level I,        overweight level II, obesity type I, obesity type II, and obesity type III. The data comprises 2111 records and 17 attributes. The records are labeled with the class   variable NObesity (Obesity Level).


# Tool Used

   Power Bi Desktop

# Data Preparation

   TThe following steps were done in order to get the data ready for analysis.

• The CSV file was imported using Power Bi.

• To ensure that the dataset is correctly cleaned before being loaded for visualization, the imported dataset was transformed using the Power Query Editor.

• From the age column, I created the age range column using conditional expression

# Summary of Findings

• Obesity Prevalence and Frequency of High-Calorie Food Consumption (FAVC): Approximately 98% of obese people report frequently consuming high-calorie meals, suggesting a     
substantial positive link between the two variables.

• Daily Water drinking (CH20) and Obesity Prevalence: about 70% of obese people report drink water daily, suggesting a weak positive association between the two variables.

 • Obesity Prevalence and Alcohol Consumption (CALC): approximately 70% of obese people report occasionally consuming alcohol, 
 
 there is no substantial positive association between the two.

• Obesity Prevalence and Food Consumption Between Meals (CAEC): About 80% of obese people report consuming food between meals, 

suggesting a moderately favorable link between the two variables.

•  Monitoring of Calories Consumed (SCC) and Obesity Prevalence: approximately 87% of obese people do not track their calorie intake,

indicating a strong positive association between the two variables.

•  pysical Activity Frequency (FAF) and Obesity Prevalence: Seventy percent of obese people report being physically active,

suggesting a weak negative association between physical activity and obesity prevalence.

 
• Obesity Prevalence and Time Spent Using Technological gadgets (TUE): about  60% of obese people  use technology gadgets, 

indicating a substantial positive link between obesity prevalence and TUE.

• Obesity prevalence and mode of transportation (MTRANS): With 60% of obese people utilizing public transit, 

there seems to be a moderately favorable association between the two variables unlike 4% from the obese people who uses walking as a mode of transportation.

# Conclusion

• Obesity and a family history of overweight are significantly correlated; about 87% of obese people report having an overweight family member.

This raises the possibility that family environments or a genetic predisposition could play a role in obesity.

• In the population under study, men are more likely than women to be obese. This suggests that the prevalence of obesity in men may be influenced by societal 

and behavioral variables, or that gender may be a major factor in defining the risk factors for obesity.

• When compared to other age groups, the 20–30 year old age range shows a higher prevalence of obesity. According to this research, 

young individuals in their 20s and 30s are more likely to be obese than other age groups. 

This may be because of the dietary preferences, lifestyle decisions, and metabolic modifications that come with this  period of life.
